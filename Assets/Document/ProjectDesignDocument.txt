Project Description and Goal:
--> Obtain a simulation (Possibly a 3D simulation)
--> Add realtime interactions to the simulation
--> Create a multiuser interface
--> Synchronise users actions in the network
--> VR visualisation of the simulation

Activity log:

--> Obtain a simulation (Possibly a 3D simulation)
// Physarum simulation is used as shown by prof. MM:  https://sagejenson.com/physarum
// Try to upgrade to a 3D simulation, Example: https://sagejenson.com/physarum

--> Add realtime interactions to the simulation
// Added a pointer interaction by prof.MM
// Changed pointer to cursor with cursor radius control using scroll
// More interaction to be added

--> Create a multiuser interface
// Added Photon Unity Networking package (PUN 2 - Free) (Upto 20 users)
// 

--> Synchronise users actions in the network
--> VR visualisation of the simulation
